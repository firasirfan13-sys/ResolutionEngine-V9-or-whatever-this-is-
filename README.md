# 🌀 SD/OS Chaos Core V9.0

A hybrid C/C++ command-line environment and resolution engine designed to handle reality-bending anomalies, animatronic threats, and crustacean processing.

## 🚀 Overview

SD/OS (Stability-Defying Operating System) is a creative simulation built to manage high-stress scenarios involving "Purple Guy" sightings, power outages, and Pringles shortages. It features a dual-layer architecture:

1.  **C-Based Shell Interface:** Handles system info, filesystem simulation, and command parsing.
2.  **C++ Resolution Engine:** A type-safe logic handler (`ResolutionStatus`) that manages willpower, power levels, and Afton containment protocols.

## 🛠 Features

* **Afton Counter-Protocol:** Automated detection and containment of William Afton.
* **FNAF Security Suite:** Functional `securityDoorSlam()` mechanics with power drain calculations.
* **Bio-Culinary Management:** Track shrimp counts and bread quality for goose-related pacification.
* **Chaos Metrics:** Real-time monitoring of "Funni levels," "Pringles reserves," and "Freddy Strength."

## 🖥️ Commands

Once the shell is running, you can use the following commands:

| Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `help` | Lists available system commands. |
| `resolve <problem>` | Runs the engine (e.g., `resolve purple guy`, `resolve shrimp`). |
| `engine status` | Displays detailed Chaos Engine and FNAF status metrics. |
| `uname` | Displays kernel and architecture info. |
| `cls` | Clears the terminal screen. |
| `activate --egg=obscure42` | [REDACTED] — Activates Goose Mode. |

## 📦 Installation & Compilation

Since the code utilizes Linux-specific headers (`<unistd.h>`, `<sys/utsname.h>`), it is best compiled on a Linux environment, macOS, or Android (via Termux).

**Using G++:**
```bash
g++ main.cpp -o chaos_core
./chaos_core
